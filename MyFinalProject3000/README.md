This project is a mobile application that allows the user to search for movies.

After searching for a movie, the results of that movie, such as movie title, date, and cast will be returned.

The first part of this application asks the user to make an account to log in with.

After logging in, the user will load up the main page, along with the functionality.

All the user has to do is search for a movie in the text box, and press the enter button after, returning the results.

At any moment, the user will have to choice to log out by pressing the logout button, located at the bottom of the main page. 

Once the user logs out, they will be redirected to the log in page, instead of the sign up page. 

All the users are stored in the Fire Base database, the app searched for user-id to check if they exist. 

When the user is registering, they must enter a email, along with a name and password. The password must be greater than 6 characters.

The appliaction also checks these conditions if the user is just trying to log in.
